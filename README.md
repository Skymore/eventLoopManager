# Event Loop Manager
- A C++ event-driven manager for concurrent task processing, finite state machines, HTTP communication and distributed message handling.
- Developed a C++ event-driven manager for concurrent task processing, finite state machines, HTTP communication and distributed message handling.
- Used C++11 features (thread, mutex, condition variable) for parallel task processing and a thread-safe JSON message queue, ensuring efficient inter-thread communication through a producer-consumer model.
- Implemented channel and event mechanisms for asynchronous communication, leveraging a singleton pattern.
- Integrated librdkafka and Confluent Kafka cluster for real-time data handling in distributed environments.
